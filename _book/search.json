Entanglement measures such the von Neumann or Renyi(*) entropies rely on a non-linear function of the reduced density matrix, \\(\\rho_\\text{A}\\), and as such is not a conventional observable that can be experimentally measured without full-state tomography or interometric approaches. Such directions are not appropriate for the study of multi-partite entanglement in solids.\nAn alternative, more practical approach instead uses entanglement witnesses to bound the entanglement within a given system using experimentally accessible quantities such as dynamic susceptibilities. One particular witness, the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) will take focus in this project, calculated from the linear response in electronic systems to build a framework of entanglement diagnostics in solids.",

    "text": "Without full state tomography, entanglement measures prove infeasible in solid state experiments that involve a large collection of many-body correlations. An alternative approach is to utilise entanglement witnesses which bounds entanglement in a given many-body system. The key objective is to build a framework to utilise such witnesses, probing the entanglement structure in driven/undriven solids whilst being experimentally accessible. One such witness is the quantum Fisher information, which probes the entanglement depth.\nThe QFI originated in quantum phase estimation where it upper bounds the Fisher information (FI) and gives the quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCR),\n\\[\n    (\\Delta \\Theta)^2 \\geq \\frac{1}{M F_Q[\\rho ; \\hat{A}]}.\n\\] Here, \\((\\Delta \\Theta)^2\\) is the variance of a parameter, \\(\\Theta\\) to be estimated, \\(M\\) is the number of independent measurements and \\(F_Q[\\hat{\\rho} ; \\hat{A}]\\) is the QFI relative to some observable, \\(\\hat{A}\\). The QCR bounds the maximal precision for parameter estimation in a quantum system and also showcases the effect of a strongly entangled state on parameter estimation, i.e it breaks the classical limit (the convential CRLB).\nFor some mixed state, $ $ and in relation to an observable \\(\\hat{A}\\), the QFI can be expressed as \\[\n    F_Q[\\rho ; \\hat{A}] = 2 \\sum_{n, m} \\frac{(P_n - P_m)^2}{P_n + P_m} |\\langle n|\\hat{A}|m\\rangle |^2,\n\\]\nwhere \\(|n\\rangle\\), \\(|m\\rangle\\) are eigenstates of \\(\\rho\\) with eigenvalues \\(P_n, P_m\\). The sum is restricted to \\(P_n + P_m &gt;0\\). For pure states, relabel the eigenstate \\(|0\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle\\) and take \\(P_n = \\delta_{n, 0}\\), such that \\(\\rho = |\\psi \\rangle\\langle \\psi |\\) . The QFI then simplifies to\n\\[\n    F_Q[|\\psi\\rangle; \\hat{A}] = 4 \\left(\\langle \\psi|\\hat{A}^2|\\psi\\rangle - \\langle \\psi|\\hat{A}|\\psi\\rangle ^2 \\right)  = 4(\\Delta \\hat{A})^2.\n\\]\nWork by showed that the QFI can be measured directly in a generic many-body system in a thermal state at any temperature, relating the QFI to the standard dynamical response (also known as a dynamical susceptibility), \\[\n    F_Q[\\rho_{\\beta}] = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d \\omega \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{2T}\\right) \\chi''(\\omega, T).\n\\]\nHere, we assume that the density operator, \\(\\rho_{\\beta}\\) describes that of a thermal state at temperature, \\(T\\), with \\(\\chi''(\\omega, T)\\) as the imaginary part of the standard response function, \\[\n    \\chi_{BA}(\\omega) =  \\lim_{\\eta \\to 0^+}i\\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\tau e^{i(\\omega + i \\eta)} \\text{tr} \\left( \\rho_{\\beta} [\\hat{B}(\\tau), \\hat{A}]\\right),\n\\] where we have an extra term in the fourier transform (\\(i \\eta\\)) to ensure convergence. Possibly add proof from notes\nIt’s relation to the dynamical susceptibility highlights it’s importance as a tool to study the entanglement structure of quantum matter, as it is an experimentally accessible quantity via well-known spectroscopic techniques (Bragg spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering as two examples). This bypasses the need for full-state tomography, a key downside to standard entanglement measures like the von Neumann and Renyi entropies.",
